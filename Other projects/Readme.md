# Prediction of daily Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths using CNN-LSTMs. Datathon submission


**Introduction**

ABOUT THE DATATHON

The COVID-19 Houston Datathon is an online challenge to predict the regional hospitalization and mortality patterns of COVID-19 in Houston, Texas. This Datathon is jointly 
organized and sponsored by the Center for Secure Artificial intelligence For hEalthcare at the UTHealth School of Biomedical Informatics, and Data to Knowledge lab at 
Rice University. Undergraduate, master, and doctoral students from the institutes within the Gulf Coast Consortia (including UTHealth, MDACC, UH, Rice, TAMU, UTMB, IBT, 
and Baylor) and colleges near TMC are highly encouraged to apply. The event will have up to $1,500 in prizes for the winners. This is an individual-based event (no team 
participation).



**Objective**

The goal is to develop a prediction model using local county-level data to estimate the changes in hospitalization and mortality rates in the greater Houston area encompassing
8 counties (Harris, Fort Bend, Montgomery, Brazoria, Galveston, Liberty, Chambers, and Austin) in the state of Texas, USA.
