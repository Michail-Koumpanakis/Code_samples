# Classification of galaxies according to morphology and shape using CNNs

**Introduction**

With the rapid increase in the amount of data regarding the features of stellar and galactic objects, it is becoming increasingly harder to
manually classify every object in the sky. Therefore, it is becoming necessary to implement machine learning methods, in order to automatically classify objects without
having to examine new data manually. In this work, we will attempt to classify galaxies using photographic images, according to their shape and morphological features.
